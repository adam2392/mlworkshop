# Machine Learning Workshop
### By: Adam Li, Joseph Yu, Drew Breithaupt
### 3/7/17

The goal for this workshop is to walk you through some very basic tools that a data scientist will use in their analysis of medical data. By the end, you should understand what are some of the limitations of a data scientist and what are some of the challenges they face.

Then I will emphasize the importance of communication and patience in collaboration between engineering and health professionals.
